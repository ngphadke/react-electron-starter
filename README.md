# My Minimal React Starter

## Background
I wanted to truly understand the behind the scenes magic that gets React apps working as I've always found Webpack, Babel to be incomprehensible. 

Additionally, as far as I've seen setting up minimal react with electron requires quite a bit of knowledge of the in's and out's of the ecosystem. This is primarily because the standard starter _`create_react_app`_ doesn't allow the `fs` node module which most electron apps would need to do anything worthwhile.
