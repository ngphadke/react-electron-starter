# My Hand Built React-Electron Starter

## Background
I want to really understand the behind the scenes magic that gets React + Electron apps working. Additionally, as far as I've seen setting up minimal react with electron requires quite a bit of knowledge of the in's and out's of the ecosystem. This is primarily because the standard starter _`create_react_app`_ doesn't allow node modules to be injected, which most electron apps would need to do anything worthwhile.

So I went ahead and followed @alexdevero's great blog post on getting React + Electron working without `create_react_app`.

## Result
While the experiment was successful in that I got things working, I couldn't truly understand how everything in what Alex explained was working.
I also found an excellent walkthrough of how to get node modules working with React even while using `create_react_app` but without **ejecting**!
